Blubby's Mod is a Minecraft 1.19.2 content mod which introduces many Items, Mobs, Blocks, and more things I think would be a nice addition to the game. This mod requires the [Architectury API](https://curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/architectury-api/files/version=1.19.2) so I can make Forge and Fabric versions of the mod. Also has JEI compatibility for custom crafting type.

# Building
If you want to build the mod, clone the repo and run ```gradlew build``` in the terminal.

The JAR file should be located in ```/[MOD PLATFORM]/build/libs```. The file in ```/common/build/libs/``` or ```/build/libs/``` will not work.
